#### observability:
+ It’s the ability to understand what’s happening inside your systems (apps, servers, containers, clusters) by looking at the signals they produce — like **logs, metrics, and traces.**
  + For example in a car, You don’t see the engine directly, but you look at the dashboard → speedometer, fuel gauge, engine light.
  + From those signals, you understand what’s happening inside the car without opening the hood.
  + **Monitoring(Metrics):** involves tracking system metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and network performance. Provides alerts based on predefined thresholds and conditions
+ **Without observability, when something breaks:**
  + You only know “app is down” but not why.
  + You spend hours guessing — is it CPU? memory? DB connection? network latency?
+ **With observability:**
  + You can quickly detect, debug, and fix issues.
  + You can even predict problems before users notice (e.g., memory leak, disk filling).
  + It helps ensure reliability, performance, and availability.
+ **Monitoring tells you “something is wrong”.**
+ **Observability tells you “why it went wrong”.**
